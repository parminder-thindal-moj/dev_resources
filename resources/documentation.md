| [**Docusaurus** ![docusaurus logo](imgs/docusaurus_logo.png)](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools) | A static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc). | **React, JavaScript, Node.js** |
| [**Jekyll**](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) | A simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories. | **Ruby, Liquid, Markdown** |
| [**Read the Docs**](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/) | Read the Docs simplifies managing software documentation by building and hosting your docs automatically, using the Git workflow you already use for code. Treating documentation like code lets your team use tools they already know, and makes keeping your docs updated easier. | **Python, Django, Sphinx** |
| [**MK Docs**](https://www.mkdocs.org) | MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. | **Python, Markdown, YAML** |
| [**Sphinx**](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) | Sphinx is a documentation generator or a tool that translates a set of plain text source files into various output formats, automatically producing cross-references, indices, etc. That is, if you have a directory containing a bunch of reStructuredText or Markdown documents, Sphinx can generate a series of HTML files, a PDF file (via LaTeX), man pages and much more. | **Python, reStructuredText, Jinja2** |
